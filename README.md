### Hi there 👋
I am passionate, problem solver, critical thinker and full stack software engineer with a passion for building systems and coming up with solutions for solving everyday challenges through technology. 

Experienced professional with multiple skills. Very diligent, attentive to details, hard working and honest.

I write super clean, readable and reusable code in JavaScript and TypeScript. Also I have an eye for great UI/UX, an extreme attention to detail, strong communication skills, and an efficient workflow.

Guru in React and React Native frameworks
I take pride in being a full spectrum developer for nearly 4 years, primarily focused on Web/Mobile based technologies. I consistently deliver high-value work with a breadth and depth of expertise that allows me to have the same work output as a small team of mid-level engineers.
As a Front-End Developer, my goal is to be essential in the creation of enjoyable user experiences by staying up to date with the best programming techniques and latest technologies and focusing on the end user's needs.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ataano...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GraphQL, Next.js, GCP on pluralsight ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for funds to finish my ataano project.
- 💬 Ask me about JavaScript, Full Stack development, JAMstack, and building cool sh*t
